# Landlords
In this project we studied the real estate rental market of the four major cities in Saudi Arabia: Jeddah, Riyadh, Alkhobar and Dammam. We explored the relationships of prices with other features. The dataset used is found on kaggle <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lama122/saudi-arabia-real-estate-aqar">Saudi Arabia Real Estate (AQAR) dataset</a> It was collected and scrapped from <a href ="https://sa.aqar.fm">Aqar.fm</a>
This report will help officials from the Ministry of Housing understand the current rental landscape for the average consumer (families and singles) in each city.
