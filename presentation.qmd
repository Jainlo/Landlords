## Introduction

* In this project we studied the real estate rental market of the four major cities in Saudi Arabia: Jeddah, Riyadh, Alkhobar and Dammam. 
* We explored the relationships of prices with other features from the Saudi Arabia Real Estate (AQAR) dataset that was collected and scrapped from Aqar.fm
Main Features we focused on:
  * City
  * Price
  * Front
  * Pool

## Data Cleaning

We started by the format of our data and checking which columns had missing values.

  * We dropped the detail column because it was the only one with missing values

    * It was also full of unstructured and inconsistent

  * We trimmed the whitespace from all the column names and rows

  * We removed duplicate 2207 rows

  * Removed the rows that have the same value in price and size

  * Removed irrelevant values from the front columns

  * Remove values with a size < 100

  * Price periods are not consistent, we made an assumption that they are monthly

    * Discard anything less than 2K

    * Anything beyond 20K is yearly and will be divided by 12
