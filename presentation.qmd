## Introduction
* In this project we studied the real estate rental market of the four major cities in Saudi Arabia: Jeddah, Riyadh, Alkhobar and Dammam. 
* We explored the relationships of prices with other features that was collected and scrapped from Aqar.fm. Main Features we focused on:
  * City
  * Price
  * Front
  * Pool

## Data Cleaning
We started by the format of our data and checking which columns had missing values.

  * We dropped the detail column because it was the only one with missing values

    * It was also full of unstructured and inconsistent

  * We trimmed the whitespace from all the column names and rows

  * We removed duplicate 2207 rows
## Data Cleaning
  * Removed the rows that have the same value in price and size

  * Removed irrelevant values from the front columns

  * Remove values with a size < 100

  * Price periods are not consistent, we made an assumption that they are monthly

    * Discard anything less than 2K

    * Anything beyond 20K is yearly and will be divided by 12
## Data Cleaning

We used a seperate districts in dataset have been grouped into location class “north, south, west, east, or center”.
This step was done manually by searching for every district in each city.

The two datasets were combined using merge() function by checking “city” and “district” columns

## Data Analysis

Which city had the most expensive real estate? 
  ```{python}
  df.groupby("city")["price"].mean()
  ```

## Data Analysis

What was the more prominent in expensive real estate?
  ```{python}
  data = [dict(
  type = 'scatter',
  x = df['front'],
  y = df['front'].count(),
  mode = 'markers',
  transforms = [dict(
    type = 'groupby',
    groups = df['front'],
  )]
  )]
  fig_dict = dict(data=data)
  pio.show(fig_dict, validate=False)
  ```

## Data Analysis

Is there a more expensive front?
  ```{python}
  def arabic_plot(labels: pd.Series):
    ArabicLabels = labels.apply(arabic_reshaper.reshape)
    result = []
    for label in ArabicLabels:
        result.append(get_display(label))
    if len(result) == 1:
        return result[0]
    else:
        return result
  sns.set_theme()
  plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))
  sns.barplot(y="price", x=arabic_plot(df["front"]), data=df)
  plt.ylabel(arabic_plot(pd.Series("الأسعار ")))
  plt.xlabel(arabic_plot(pd.Series("الواجهات")))
  plt.title(arabic_plot(pd.Series(" أسعار الأجار حسب الواجهات")))
  ```

## Data Analysis

Which cities tend to have more pools?

## Conclusion

* Real estate has higher prices in Jeddah compared to Riyadh, Dammam and Alkhobar (on the date of data collection)
* The features that are more prominent in expensive real estate in order are:
  * house includes a driver's room
  * house has a frontyard
  * house has a garage
* The most expensive front out of the 4 main directions is "East", while "North-east" is the most expensive overall
