## Introduction

In this project we studied the real estate rental market of the four major cities in Saudi Arabia: Jeddah, Riyadh, Alkhobar and Dammam. We explored the relationships of prices with other features. The dataset used is found on kaggle <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lama122/saudi-arabia-real-estate-aqar">Saudi Arabia Real Estate (AQAR) dataset</a> It was collected and scrapped from <a href ="https://sa.aqar.fm">Aqar.fm</a>

## Data Cleaning

We started by the format of our data and checking which columns had missing values.

  * We dropped the detail column because it was the only one with missing values

    * It was also full of unstructured and inconsistent

  * We trimmed the whitespace from all the column names and rows

  * We removed duplicate 2207 rows

  * Removed the rows that have the same value in price and size

  * Removed irrelevant values from the front columns

  * Remove values with a size < 100

  * Price periods are not consistent, we made an assumption that they are monthly

    * Discard anything less than 2K

    * Anything beyond 20K is yearly and will be divided by 12
