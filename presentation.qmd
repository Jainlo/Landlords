## Introduction

* In this project we studied the real estate rental market of the four major cities in Saudi Arabia: Jeddah, Riyadh, Alkhobar and Dammam. 
* We explored the relationships of prices with other features from the Saudi Arabia Real Estate (AQAR) dataset that was collected and scrapped from Aqar.fm
Main Features we focused on:
  * City
  * Price
  * Front
  * Pool

## Data Cleaning

We started by the format of our data and checking which columns had missing values.

  * We dropped the detail column because it was the only one with missing values

    * It was also full of unstructured and inconsistent

  * We trimmed the whitespace from all the column names and rows

  * We removed duplicate 2207 rows

  * Removed the rows that have the same value in price and size

  * Removed irrelevant values from the front columns

  * Remove values with a size < 100

  * Price periods are not consistent, we made an assumption that they are monthly

    * Discard anything less than 2K

    * Anything beyond 20K is yearly and will be divided by 12

## Data Analysis

Which city had the most expensive real estate? 
  ```{python}
  df.groupby("city")["price"].mean()
  ```

## Data Analysis

What was the more prominent in expensive real estate?
  ```{python}
  data = [dict(
  type = 'scatter',
  x = df['front'],
  y = df['front'].count(),
  mode = 'markers',
  transforms = [dict(
    type = 'groupby',
    groups = df['front'],
  )]
  )]
  fig_dict = dict(data=data)
  pio.show(fig_dict, validate=False)
  ```

## Data Analysis

Is there a more expensive front?
  ```{python}
  def arabic_plot(labels: pd.Series):
    ArabicLabels = labels.apply(arabic_reshaper.reshape)
    result = []
    for label in ArabicLabels:
        result.append(get_display(label))
    if len(result) == 1:
        return result[0]
    else:
        return result
  sns.set_theme()
  plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))
  sns.barplot(y="price", x=arabic_plot(df["front"]), data=df)
  plt.ylabel(arabic_plot(pd.Series("الأسعار ")))
  plt.xlabel(arabic_plot(pd.Series("الواجهات")))
  plt.title(arabic_plot(pd.Series(" أسعار الأجار حسب الواجهات")))
  ```

## Data Analysis

Which cities tend to have more pools?

## Conclusion

* Real estate has higher prices in Jeddah compared to Riyadh, Dammam and Alkhobar (on the date of data collection)
* The features that are more prominent in expensive real estate in order are:
  * house includes a driver's room
  * house has a frontyard
  * house has a garage
* The most expensive front out of the 4 main directions is "East", while "North-east" is the most expensive overall
