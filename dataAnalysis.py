# year of collection: 2020
# all are rental
# rental period differs making it hard to compare prices => make an assumption
# type of property is not included

#%%Run and clean the data
df = pd.read_csv('SA_Aqar.csv')
clean(df)

######------DATA EXPLORATION------######
#%% general information
df.info()

#%% Column names
df.columns

#%% automated report
create_report(df)

#%% Interesting variables
# Price vs (?)
# Property age vs (?)
# Pool with size
# Pool with city

######Questions######
# Is there a perferred front?
# Is there a front that is more expensive?
# Which cities tend to have more pools? Could there be a reason?
# Whats the average price per district
# Are there cities with more driver_rooms
# Are there cities with more basements? Could there be a reason?
# Which city has the highest/lowest rent rate?

######Plots######
# seaborn or matplotlib or plotly
# make sure to add x labels and y labels and title
# change color palettes
# can change hue
# can change sizes
# can change figsize
# can change alpha value
# can use Horizontal bar Plots with 0 and 1 variable
# can use Smooth kernel density with marginal histograms to spot concentration of data points
# can use animation frame/ animation group

######Conclusions######
# Can we conclude that real estate has higher prices in one city more than the other three?
# Can we conclude which feature is more prominent in expensive real estate?

# Q3. Is there a front that is more expensive?
# Bar plot with x = front y = price
# Explain the error bar (std) : 
# Its a graphical representations of the variability of data 
# and used on graphs to indicate the error or uncertainty in a reported measurement.
